Requirements
------------
CVSAnalY needs the following dependencies:

    * cvs
    * subversion
    * python-2.x-MySQLdb
    * mysql-server
    * gnuplot
    * apache
    * mod_php
    * php5

Install
-------
You can install cvsanaly running setup.py script:

    # python setup.py install

If you don't have root privileges, add to your $PATH the directory which contains cvsanaly.

    $ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/cvsanaly/

You are ready to use cvsanaly!

Running cvsanaly
----------------

For the impatient: just checkout (from svn or cvs) to obtain a local
version of your repository, and then run cvsanaly:

    $ cd project/
    ~/project$ cvsanaly -u <user> -p <passwd> -d <database> -r <repo>

<user> is the user of MySQL
<passwd> is the password of MySQL for that user
<database> is the name of the database in MySQL to use
<repo> is svn or cvs (svn by default)

More options, and a more detailed info about the options, can be
learnt by running "cvsanaly -h"

Analysis
--------

After feeding the database with information, CVSAnalY performs several
analysis on that data:

- generations:

    Analysis on who has been working in the project. Data produced
    can be feed to gnuplot's splot for visualization


Credits
-------

CVSAnalY has been developed by the GSyC/LibreSoft group at the
Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Móstoles, near Madrid (Spain). It is
part of a wider research on libre software engineering, aimed to gain
knowledge on how libre software is developed and maintained.
