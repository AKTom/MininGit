==============
cvsanaly 1.0.1
==============

New plugins:

    * Generations plugin written by Jesus M. Gonzalez-Barahona

Bug Fixes:

    * Create and fill database when it doesn't exist before running 
      a plugin. Running cvsanaly twice is no longer needed (Carlos Garcia Campos)
    * Generate evolution graphics in graphs plugin (Carlos Garcia Campos)
    * Rework plugins system. Support for plugins specific command 
      line options (Carlos Garcia Campos)
    * Look for cvs/svn binaries in PATH instead of using /usr/bin. 
      Option --path has been removed (Carlos Garcia Campos)

Thanks:
