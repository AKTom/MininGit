================
cvsanaly 1.99.90
================

This is the first relase of cvsanaly2 (2.0.0-beta1), a complete rework
of CVSAnalY. 

New Features:

    * Support for MySQL and SQLite, althought MySQL is the recommended
      one (and default option) because it gives better
      performance. SQLite is recommended for debuging or for small
      projects. 
    * Improved file handling. The whole history is stored in the
      repository so that the files tree can be rebuilt for any
      given revision. It's possible to get the path of any file at any
      given revision even if it (or any of its parents) has been moved
      or renamed.
    * Committer and Author fields for systems like git and bzr that
      differenciate between them.
    * Option to save the logfile into a local path while parsing.
    * Tags and branches support.
    * Additional information not contained in the repository log can
      be optionally added to the database by using extensions. At the
      moment there are three extensions available: FileTypes,
      CommitsLOC and Metrics.
    * Multiple repositories can be analyzed using a single database.
    * New database design which fits much better with all source code
      management systems.
    * Configuration file support.
    * New code design, more efficient and extensible.
    * Better performance, it's quite faster performing the whole
      analysis proccess.
    * New and improved log parsers with support for CVS, SVN and
      Git. There's also a preliminary Bazaar support.
