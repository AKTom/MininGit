================
cvsanaly 1.99.91
================

This the last beta release of cvsanaly2. Next releases (release
candidates and final release) will only contain bug fixes and
documentation updates.

Database Schema Changes:

    * commit_id has been removed from the file_types table.
    * A new view (action_files) has been added to be able to match the
      file_id associated to the action independently of the action
      type. This is needed because in a replace action might involve 3
      files: the file being replaced, the new file replacing the
      old one and the file from which the replacement is done. In
      these cases the new file is not stored in the actions table, but
      in the to_id field of file_copies table. This view is almost a
      copy of the actions table but the file_id will be taken from
      file_copies for replace actions. 

New Features:

    * Add a command line option (-n, --no-parse) to be able to skip
      the parsing process when used in conjunction with --extensions
    * Add git support in Metrics extension
    * Use a persistent cache on disk to store the caches used in
      DBContentHandler. This makes running CVSAnalY incrementally
      finally work
    * Store -1 values in the database instead of NULL when the file
      failed to be measured, so that it can be tried again in a
      another CVSAnalY execution. NULL values are now reserved for the
      files that are not supported.
    * Try again up to 3 times when a checkout/update fails, just in
      case it's just a short temporary network problem, in Metrics
      extension
    * Use the Command.py module in Metrics extension which provides
      better error handling
    * Instead of a single config file a directory is used now to store
      the config file and the state of the caches used in
      DBContentHandler needed to incrmentally run CVSAnalY. The old
      configuration is automatically migrated. 
    * Subsets of repositories can be analyzed and treated as
      individual repositories. Specially useful to analyze SVN
      repositorires with 'modules'

Performance Fixes and Improvements:

    * All queries have been reviewed and optimized
    * CommitsLOC extension has been reworked, so that for CVS and Git
      repositories we extract the information from the log command
      instead of running diffs which drastically improves the
      performance. 
    * Do not run executemany if we don't have any data to insert in
      FileTypes and CommitsLOC extensions
    * Do not find te same program in PATH more than once in Metrics
      extension
    * Split the temp_log query into several queries to save memory
    * Use a maximum size in queues, blocking on put() when the queue
      is full, in order to save memory

Documentation:

    * Add documentation in texi format. Not finished yet.
    * Update the manpage
      
Bug Fixes:

    * Remove the tempdir used in Metrics extension when the extension
      is aborted 
    * Do not use deprecated python stuff
    * Fix infinite loop in DBContentHandler when a path has been
      renamed several times to the same name
    * Do not crash when the Metrics extension doesn't support the
      repository type, raise an exception instead. 
    * Fix a crash with repositories where paths don't start with '/' 
    * Fix the main queries used in FileTypes and Metrics extensions by
      using the new action_files view to make sure we always get the
      right file_id.
    * Fix incosistency issues between the cache used in
      DBContentandler and the database
    * Several fixes in the SVN parser.

================
cvsanaly 1.99.90
================

This is the first relase of cvsanaly2 (2.0.0-beta1), a complete rework
of CVSAnalY. 

New Features:

    * Support for MySQL and SQLite, althought MySQL is the recommended
      one (and default option) because it gives better
      performance. SQLite is recommended for debuging or for small
      projects. 
    * Improved file handling. The whole history is stored in the
      repository so that the files tree can be rebuilt for any
      given revision. It's possible to get the path of any file at any
      given revision even if it (or any of its parents) has been moved
      or renamed.
    * Committer and Author fields for systems like git and bzr that
      differenciate between them.
    * Option to save the logfile into a local path while parsing.
    * Tags and branches support.
    * Additional information not contained in the repository log can
      be optionally added to the database by using extensions. At the
      moment there are three extensions available: FileTypes,
      CommitsLOC and Metrics.
    * Multiple repositories can be analyzed using a single database.
    * New database design which fits much better with all source code
      management systems.
    * Configuration file support.
    * New code design, more efficient and extensible.
    * Better performance, it's quite faster performing the whole
      analysis proccess.
    * New and improved log parsers with support for CVS, SVN and
      Git. There's also a preliminary Bazaar support.
