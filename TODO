TODO
====

[X] number of files quite different from previous version
[X] use argv instead of annoying config file
[X] Basic tables should be only three: files, log and commiter (jgb)
[X] checkout?
[ ] implement cvsanaly --revision flag
[ ] implement cvsanaly --branch bug

23th January
============
[X] add graphs from graphs/ directory
[X] Autodetect svn/cvs (better than --type flag)
[X] Directory table contains fields without utility (left, right, father_id).
[ ] there is no way to pass options flags from command line to plugins.
[ ] cvsanal_temp_commiters takes long time when high number of modules. Idea: make stats only for 20 first most active directories.

24th January
===========
[ ] Extract min and max dates from graph_heatmaps. Create functions to get actual date.
[ ] port polygini to python
[ ] add commiters_module table
